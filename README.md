This is a converter from [Camunda BPMN](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) to [HTML](diagram.html) 
to enable viewing without any extra tool.

Includes a clickable map and a list of the documentation, which is not visible in the image alone.

* Use "Extensions - Properties - Add" property with name "link" to add a link to external target or documentation
* Save as .bpmn file to a known location
* Export as image (.png) into the same directory (required)
* Run [bpmn2html.py](bpmn2html.py) in this directory, it will convert all .bpmn files, which have a .png with equal name
